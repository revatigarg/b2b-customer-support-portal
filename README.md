# Commerce Operations Support Prototype

Live Demo:

## Overview

This project explores how structured support workflows can reduce merchant friction in eCommerce platforms.

Built using Lovable for rapid prototyping and version-controlled through GitHub to simulate real product iteration workflows.

The goal is not to build a production support system, but to model how commerce issue intake, categorization, and escalation logic can be designed intentionally.

---

## Problem Context

In commerce platforms, unclear issue categorization increases:

- Resolution time
- Merchant frustration
- Support costs
- Escalation complexity

Free-text tickets and ambiguous routing create operational inefficiencies, especially at scale.

This prototype explores how structured workflows can improve clarity and reduce back-and-forth.

## What This Prototype Models

### 1. Structured Issue Intake

Categorized merchant issue flows across commerce lifecycle areas:

- Checkout and payment issues
- Order fulfillment concerns
- Refund and return workflows
- Inventory discrepancies
- Platform or app-related problems

### 2. Routing and Escalation Logic

- Defined intake categories
- Clear escalation pathways
- Intentional separation of issue types
- Reduced
